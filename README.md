# MYPHARMA: A Pharmacy For All Your Needs

- We have designed a system by using an object oriented paradigm where all the medical stores are present on the single platform. 

- We have implemented this by forming several classes, each of them working can be understood by the screenshots below.

- We have tried to build a user friendly application. We have implemented an actionListner interface so that we can perform certain actions when clicking the buttons.

- Inorder to design the panel and setting background images adjusted with margin we used swing library in java.

- We have used sql to store the entered entries by including jar files which works as a jdbc driver.

## Goals
